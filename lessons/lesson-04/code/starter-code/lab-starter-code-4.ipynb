This represents a 20% chance that the impact of X6 upon the dependent varaible would simply occur by chance.  A p-value of 5% or less is generally considered to be statistically significant, and X6 is far above this.  "

    "Answer: Not necessarily - this depends largely on what question the research is attempting to answer.  If we are simply trying to determine if bigger animals have bigger brains, the data would back this.  However, this is leaving out a huge number of outside factors - and frankly, doesn't answer much.  It's obvious that an elephant will have a larger brain than a parakeet, but this reveals very little else.  Larger brains do not necessarily lead to things like greater intelligence, memory, and problem solving.  An elephant's brain is around three times larger than a human's, yet a human undoubtedly has greater intelligence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative hypothesis that could be more revealing would be to control for individual species or genomes - for example, do larger birds have larger brains, and does the same pattern occur in mammals? This leads to further questions when we include factors like gender, environment, or health.  Controlling for individual species allows us to focus specifically on the body size to brain size coefficient and draw more effective conclusions."
